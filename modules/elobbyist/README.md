A Drupal 7 module: Mass lobby by email through subscribers' own email accounts

This module allows individual activists and small groups to easily setup web-based lobby-by-email campaigns.
The major difference from other solutions is in the reliance on subscribers' own email credentials rather than on independent mail servers.
